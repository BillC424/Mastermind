Command line based Mastermind game (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) between a human player and a computer player. The human player can choose to be either a codemaker or a codebreaker. When playing as the codebreaker, the computer player has logic to retain choices that are in the correct position/color and to include colors that were chosen in previous rounds, but were in the incorrect spot.
